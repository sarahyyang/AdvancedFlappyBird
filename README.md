# AdvancedFlappyBird

Flappy Bird is a 2D mobile game developed by Dong Nguyen. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. 

Advanced Flappy Bird adds additonal obstacles to the original Flappy Bird, such as the opponent bird in the middle of pipes.
